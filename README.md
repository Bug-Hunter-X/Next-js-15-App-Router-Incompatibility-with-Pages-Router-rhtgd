# Next.js 15 App Router Incompatibility

This repository demonstrates a common error encountered when migrating or creating projects in Next.js 15 related to the introduction of the App Router.  The primary issue stems from attempting to use the legacy Pages Router structure with the new App Router architecture.  This results in unexpected errors or incorrect rendering behaviors.

## Bug Description:

The core problem is a mismatch between the expected routing mechanism (App Router) and the code written for the older Pages Router. Attempting to utilize traditional `pages` directory structures and components within a Next.js 15 project configured for App Router will lead to runtime errors or incorrect rendering of pages.

## Solution:

The solution involves a change to the project structure and approach to routing:

1. **Migrate to App Router:**  The recommended approach for Next.js 15 is to fully adopt the App Router structure.  This typically involves refactoring your application to use the `app` directory and the new routing conventions. 
2. **Remain with Pages Router (Not Recommended):** If using Pages Router, ensure the files are placed in the correct directory structure.  Next.js 15 still supports Pages Router but it's officially deprecated in favor of the App Router, so this solution is not recommended for new projects or large-scale applications.
